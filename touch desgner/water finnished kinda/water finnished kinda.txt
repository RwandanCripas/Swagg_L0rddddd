For my "Wave final kind of" project my aim was to try make an animation of waves in the ocean. To achieve this i started off by playing around with noise TOPs to try make a wavy texture animation. I passed my noise top watery image into a displace TOP that has a noise CHOP into a CHOP to TOP converter. This noise chop distorts the image with a wave effect following the data passed into it. At first I was using this plugged into a comp after the render but this just showed it as a flat material masked onto the 3D object. So instead i used a constant and used the null as the colour map. I used a grid that is modified by noise create the wavy effect. Plugged the noise SOP into a geometry COMP, I then set the contant to be the render material of the geometry. This geo accompanied by a light and a cam are outputted into a render. I tried to play around with a luma blur to create a hazy effect to the final image. I plugged the render into a luma blur TOP with a ramp TOP attached. The luma blur goes into a comp set to atop with a feedback loop containing some noise TOPs one using absTime.seconds to change the z translation. This was plugged into a comp set to atop and then an out. Overall i liked the textures that I used for the water and the background but I did not like the composition of it. I could not figure out how to use the camera properly to orientate my object correctly.
