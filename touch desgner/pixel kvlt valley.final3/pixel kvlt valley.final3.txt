For "pixel kvlt valley" I used my system from my Minecraft file. A ramp is used with a flip and a reorder to create a green and red mesh that is then applied to a constant by plugging it into the colour map. This constant is then plugged into the colour material ont the geometry. This with camera and a light is sent to the render, producing an object with an image. The image is sent through a feedback loop this feedback TOP rearranges he pattern of grids it also has a keyboard in CHOP linked with a null CHOP. The keyboard in is linked with the pulse setting on the feedback loop so every time the key 1 is pressed the feedback resets. I then used a movie file in into a fit TOP into a remap. The fit and remap allow for the video file to fit to the square grids. This then goes into a null, then a 3D texture and an edge into a lookup with a ramp attached into a pixelate palate tool. This pixelate and 3D texture are plugged into a tima that controls the amount of delay and trail on the edge pixelation effect. This is fed into a null then another loop with an emboss to place more effect on the edges. These both go into a comp, and then an out to view. This system is then plugged into my system from my other kvlt vally mosh iterations where the edges are pixelated and combined with color luminance difference creating a single video output. In this instance placed the "Mosh effect on the video behind the main video and angled the camera before the render in order to have these diagonal streaks of color in the final video that are affected and change at different sound levels.
