KULT VALLY MOST Audio 5.1 uses 2 different sections with edge pixelation loops. A movie file in is used to introduce the video file, this goes into a 3D texture top and an edge into a lookup with a ramp attached into a pixelation palate tool. This takes the selected edge of the picture and applies pixelation to it. when plugged into the tima this ads the delay on the pixelation making the effect visible. these are then sent through loops with an emboss to to emphasise the edges. One of these two sections goes into a pixelate before going into the comp set on luminance difference. This combines the videos by subtracting the lighting of one away from the other. This is plugged into a lookup that has a noise TOP that has monochrome turned off The translate is set to receive data from the CHOP audio switch that I have created. The noise moves when the sound peaks. This is fed into the lookup so when the sound peaks the change in color is far more chaotic. This is fed into another lookup with a ramp attached to narrow down the main colors that I want, this than goes into an out for viewing and a movie file out because I recorded a scene.
