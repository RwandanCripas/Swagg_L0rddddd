this is an improved version of camera reactive where I started with a video device in chop to take the cameras output I then put this into a chroma top so I could use the lighting values to select a certain range of values. This is plugged into a null, this null is then plugged into the TOP Name of the trace sop. The edges of the image are then traced. Where this iteration differed is I plugged this into the particle SOP that draws a repeating particle randomly at any point correlating to the trace data. I plugged this into a geometry COMP in order to turn this into a shape that along with the camera and light COMPS output to the render top. The render is plugged into a compilation with a ramp in order to colour the particles. This then was plugged into another comp TOP that compiled the particle effect atop another ramp. This was then plugged into an out TOP to finish the function and allow for viewing.
