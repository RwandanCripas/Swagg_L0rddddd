This iteration uses 3 different sections with edge pixelation loops. A movie file in is used to introduce the video file, this goes into a 3D texture top and an edge into a lookup with a ramp attached into a pixelation palate tool. This takes the selected edge of the picture and applies pixelation to it. when plugged into the tima this ads the delay on the pixelation making the effect visible. these are then sent through loops with an emboss to emphasise the edges. Where this iteration differed is I tried to see what could be audio controlled. I was trying to find the best way to control the amount of edge pixelation in respect to the music. It could not be done as it requires a lot of power and would just crashed whenever Tried to do it. I found this way of doing it but it only  pixelates the edges slightly.
