for my wave.final project I used a similar method to my wave finished kinda project except I improved and refined my design, I wanted this design to look like some sort of retro game, ps2 era. I started off by using 2 different feedback loops in succession. These contained noise TOPs that have been set to be controlled by absTime.seconds. I played around with these feedback loops until i found my desired pattern. I plugged this into a lookup with a ramp attached to select certain colours this was then fed trough a displace TOP with attached audio oscillator to noise to CHOP to TOP converter. This converter changes the chop data into readable data for the displace to use. The image is warped in a wave motion. I fed the d final null of my noise section into the colour map on a constant MAP. I used a grid that I modified to be wavy by being sent into a noise SOP, the noise SOP went into a geo COMP that then has the contant to be set as the material. This wraps the constant material onto the 3D shape of the geo. I used a grid into a particle that has the other wavy grids geometry attached. This makes the particles spawn from the edge of the geometry. This is sent through a noise SOP into a geometry COMP along With a light and camera and the other geometry COMP a scene is rendered I passed this wave render through a pixelate image filter, I combined this wave image and a ramp set to a circular type with absTime.seconds controlling the phase ran into another pixelate image filter. by plugging both these int a comp set to atop. This is run into an out for viewing.
