For this Particle reaction I used a Circle SOP into a transform to change the size into a sort SOP into a particle SOP to randomize the point at which the particles are generated.  This is ran into a null with geo comp attached. This geo COMP has its material set to a oval point sprite. The geometry COMP along with a light COMP and camera COMP all output to the render TOP in order to create a scene. Render is plugged into a feedback loop and splits of into a feedback and a comp. The feedback TOP runs into a compilation that has a movie file in connected to a level running in. This comp TOP is set to multiply and runs into an edge top that goes into the same comp that the render is running to connect the loop. this comp TOP is set to add and runs back into the target of the feed back TOP. This loop causes an edge to start from each particle and periodically trace along the edge derived from the movie file in until the edge is fully drawn. This is ran into a lookup with a ramp attached to change the colour values. This then goes into an out to view.
