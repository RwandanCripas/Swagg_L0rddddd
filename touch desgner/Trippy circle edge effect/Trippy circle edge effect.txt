For my "trippy circle edge effect" I used a circle top that has been set to open arc for the circle to be just an edge. This edge is modified by being but through a carve and extrude which selects how much of the circle is drawn and how much the shape is extruded. this is sent into a texture that slits of into a transform into another null to make a copy of the shape yet smaller. Both these nulls are fed into geometry COMPs that are instanced using the confines of the original circle. This is done by having two separate channels out of the original circle that are connected to a transform that has its rotate coordinates controlled by absTime.seconds. This makes the shape rotate over time. The geometry COMPs along with the light and camera are sent to a render TOP. This render TOP is sent trough two sections of comp TOPs attached to ramps in order to select the right colours.
