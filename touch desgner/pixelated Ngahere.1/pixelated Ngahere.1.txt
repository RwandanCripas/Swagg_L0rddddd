For my "pixelated ngahere" project I used a movie file in TOP the enters into a loop. This movie file in TOP splits into 3 channels a 3D texture TOP an edge TOP and a level top. The 3D texture TOP heads into a time machine TOP before a map TOP. The edge TOP heads into a pixelate that then splits of into the time machine TOP and the matte TOP.  The level TOP goes into both channels of a noise TOP before going into a threshold TOP and then the matte TOP This loop allows for an edge to be taken from the image, pixelated and then reinstated to the original image to create a pixelated edge effect.
