For my "Seth mosh" I used a movie file in TOP and The edges are embossed and then plugged into a comp set to luminance difference along with plugging through the original image. This was sent into a mosh feedback loop which is compiled of a fit that branches into a feedback and a level, this feedback is sent into a difference TOP which is then sent to a displace TOP and then an add TOP. The level TOP also is plugged into both the difference TOP, the displace TOP and add TOP. This creates a feedback loop where the information from the level is taken and the difference between the feedback and level is taken and displaced and then added to the image again to create a repeating effect where the certain pixel points drag down. This is then sent into a null and an out for viewing.
