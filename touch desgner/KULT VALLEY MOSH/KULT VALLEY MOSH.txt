For this version of CULT VALLEY Mosh I used two two edge pixelation loops and used them to combine two video clips so the edge of one video interacts with the other video in a pixelated matter. It is done by useing 2 different sections. A movie file in is used to introduce the video file, this goes into a 3D texture top and an edge into a lookup with a ramp attached into a pixelation palate tool. This takes the selected edge of the picture and applies pixelation to it. when plugged into the tima this ads the delay on the pixelation making the effect visible. these are then sent through loops with an emboss to emphasise the edges the null and emboss then are plugged into a comp set on luminance difference. This combines the videos by subtracting the lighting of one away from the other making the edge pixelation visible and letting it react with that of the other video.
