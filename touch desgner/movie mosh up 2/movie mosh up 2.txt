For my "Movie mosh up" I used several movie files in connected to a switch TOP that has the index controlled by a Timer CHOP into a math CHOP into a null. This makes the images cycle through in order. This is plugged into a transform that makes the images move to the left in a repeating motion. with another movie file in. The edges are embossed and then plugged into a comp set to luminance difference along with plugging through the original image. This was sent into a mosh feedback loop which is compiled of a fit that branches into a feedback and a level, this feedback is sent into a difference TOP which is then sent to a displace TOP and then an add TOP. The level TOP also is plugged into both the difference TOP, the displace TOP and add TOP. This creates a feedback loop where the information from the level is taken and the difference between the feedback and level is displaced and then added to the image again to create a repeating effect where the certain pixel points drag down. This is then fed into a noise TOP that has been set to monochrome off and the z translate has been set to change with time. This makes the selected colours randomly change over time. This is then fed into another lookup with a ramp attached to select only certain colors. It is ended with an out to view. I was going to set the image properly so it has no boarders but I like how the clean boarders contrast the abstract nature of the Video moshing
