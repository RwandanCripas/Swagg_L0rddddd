For my noise noise iteration I wanted to find out how to use the sound chop to control a variable of a TOP. I used an audio file in that splits of into a audio device out for the sound to be played through the speakers and a math is used to smooth this data out. this is fed into a audio spectrum that is set to visualisation. This allows the data to be seen from a scale of low end to high end. this data is plugged into a analyze that takes the average of this data and splits it into a envelope and a math where the envelope is plugged into the math. This loop with the envelope allows the change in data to be amplified. This is plugged into a trigger and then null. This trigger is activated when the audio data reaches past 0.5 so any data that is past this point is sent trough the null to the noise TOP where it controls the seed of the noise.
