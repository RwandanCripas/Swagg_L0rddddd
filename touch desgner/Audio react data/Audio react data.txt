This pixelated animation switches to being pixelated when the beat reaches a certain volume. when switched on it is most pixelated and as the beat reaches its highest peaks the amount of pixels increases. 

This is achieved by using a chop audio file in to select a audio file from my files. This then goes into a math chop, this math chop controls the range of the output of the audio file in narrowing the variety of the output. This math is then fed into a trigger. The trigger takes the data from math5 and modifies the data to trigger on and off when the output of math reaches past or goes below a certain value. The trigger is then fed into a select that selects only channel one out of the two channels this is then feeds into the select chop. I have set this to select only channel one. A math chop is then used again to smooth out the data making it only read a certain range of values. This then is fed into a limit that limits the data between 1 and 40. This section is plugged into a chop null to end. 

A movie file in is used to select my video clip from my files this is plugged into a pixelate tool, the Chop null is then plugged into the horizontal and vertical pixel size sliders and set to export chop. This allows the chop data that has been transformed out of the original audio file in to control the size of the pixelation effect. This is then plugged into a out top in order for the final image to be viewed.
