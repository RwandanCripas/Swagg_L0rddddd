For KULT VALLEY MOSH Audio Mooooosh I used the mosh effect that I Made in Minecraft File and plugged this into the pixelation edge effect. This is created by using Audio file in is plugged into an audio device out so the audio is outputted out the speakers. It is also plugged into a noise CHOP to allow there to be three channels to control the x, y, and z coordinates of the geometry COMP. A ramp is used with a flip and a reorder to create a green and red mesh that is then applied to a constant by plugging it into the colour map. This constant is then plugged into the colour material ont the geometry. This with  camera and a light is sent to the render, producing an image. The image is sent through a feedback loop this feedback TOP has a keyboard in CHOP linked with a null CHOP. The keyboard in is linked with the pulse setting on the feedback loop so every time the key 1 is pressed the feedback resets. I then used a movie file in into a fit TOP into a remap. The fit and remap allow for the video file to fit to the square grids. This then goes into a null, then a 3D texture and an edge into a lookup with a ramp attached into a pixelate palate tool. This pixelate and 3D texture are plugged into a tima that controls the amount of delay and trail on the edge pixelation effect. This is fed into a null then another loop with an emboss to place more effect on the edges. This including another clip that has been passed through an edge pixelation loop both go into a comp that is set to luma difference, this creates a picture that can be plugged into a lookup attached with a noise top which the z translate is controlled by my audio file in Chop data that has been modified. This lookup is sent through another lookup with ramp attached so i can choose specific colors and then fed into an out for viewing.
