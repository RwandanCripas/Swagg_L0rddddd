I started with a video device in chop to take the cameras output I then put this into a chroma top so I could use the lighting values to select a certain range of values. This is plugged into a null, this null is then plugged into the TOP Name of the trace sop. The edges of the image are then traced. I plugged this into a geometry COMP in order to turn this into a shape that along with the camera and light COMPS output to the render top.  I then plugged this render into a comp top set to multiply with a ramp attached this colors the outline. Another compilation with a ramp attached is plugged into but set to atop in the operation. This is plugged into an out.
