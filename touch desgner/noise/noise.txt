For my noise project I wanted to make sounds that I could sample and use for a song. I played around with the Audio file in CHOP and other audio oscillator and audio filter CHOPs till I found a sound that I liked then recorded it. I used my CHOP data switch that I made to control the base frequency of the second oscillator. This made the volume of the oscillator to pan on and off using the data from another oscillator. This run into an audio device out that allows the sound to be played through the speakers.
