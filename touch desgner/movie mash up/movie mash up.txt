For my "Movie mash up" I used several movie files in connected to a switch TOP that has the index controlled by a Timer CHOP into a math CHOP into a null. This makes the images cycle through in order. This is plugged into a transform that makes the images move to the left in a repeating motion. This is then plugged into my image moshing setup, with another movie file in. The edges are embossed and then plugged into a comp set to luminance difference along with plugging through the original image. This makes the two clips combine into one image with a slight emboss on the edges to differentiate. This is then fed into a noise TOP that has been set to monochrome off and the z translate has been set to change with time. This makes the selected colours randomly change over time. This is then fed into another lookup with a ramp attached to select only certain colors. It is ended with an out to view.
